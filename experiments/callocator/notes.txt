When ignoring signal 30 (sigpwr) and sleeping then goehm gc hangs.

Once the program hangs, it is not resume even after sleep period is over.

If we do not ignore the signal and looping sleep, it seems to work.
gcc -o themain -DMT -DGCOL -L../../gc/lib -I../../gc/include  -lpthread -lgc themain.c

Ok, the hanging issue solved by not blocking the SIG_PWR and using usleep in cycle.
