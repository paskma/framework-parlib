A framework for programs that can be compiled by pypy-sc (pypy standalone compiler), 
  see https://github.com/paskma/pypy-sc

A (multithreaded) Python program based on this framework can:

- run on the top of standard Python interpreter,
- be translated to C, compiled and than run natively in the OS,
- be translated to Java byte-code and then run on the top of JVM or be examined by Java Pathfinder

If we take advantage of this multi-backend design, we can:

- prototype applications rapidly as it can run without compilation,
- embrace the flexibility of the dynamically typed language and use new paradigms such as AOP, DbC and DSL,
- embrace the formal methods, for instance the model checking with the help of Java Pathfinder,
- generate very compact and high performance machine code.

It is mainly a research experiment.
A bunch of examples included.
